# Babashka Emacs Pod

A [babashka pod](https://github.com/babashka/pods) that exposes Emacs to babashka scripts.

## But why?

I got the idea for this project when I was trying out [clime](https://github.com/cosmicz/clime) to expose some elisp functions as a command line (CLI) tool. 
It worked, but I wasn't sure I wanted to learn another CLI framework. What if I could use [lambdaisland/cli][lambdaisland] or [babashka/cli][bb-cli] 
instead?

It a crazy idea. But it may be useful for those of us with a large amount of elisp we have built up over time, and want to use it beyond the editor.

It seems to be stable, but I'm not sure how far this project can go :) File an issue if there is something you need.

[lambdaisland]: https://github.com/lambdaisland/cli
[bb-cli]: https://github.com/babashka/cli

## What's here

This project bundles in these excellent elisp libraries:

- [https://github.com/clojure-emacs/parseedn](parseedn)
- [https://github.com/clojure-emacs/parseclj](parseclj)
- [https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-bencode](emacs-bencode)

It implements the [https://github.com/babashka/pods#the-protocol](pod protocol) and provides an API for some common emacs packages:

- org mode
- org roam
- calc

These packages are downloaded with use-package and required when they are used. The idea is to add a large library of emacs packages to this project over time.

```
(require '[pod.babashka.emacs.org-roam :as roam]) ;; org-roam downloaded and required here
```

## Requirements

- **babashka** — to run your scripts and load the pod.
- **Emacs** — The pod resolves an Emacs binary for the host
  architecture. If you
  already have Emacs on your `PATH`, it is used as-is. See
  [Emacs resolution](#emacs-resolution).

## Quickstart

Load the pod by local path and call it:

```clojure
(require '[babashka.pods :as pods])
(pods/load-pod ["./pod-babashka-emacs"])

(require '[pod.babashka.emacs :as emacs]
         '[pod.babashka.emacs.org :as org])

;; Evaluate Emacs Lisp, get EDN back:
(emacs/eval "(+ 1 2)")            ;=> 3
(emacs/eval "(upcase \"hi\")")    ;=> "HI"

;; Read an org file through real org-mode:
(org/outline "examples/sample.org")
;;=>
;; {:file "/abs/path/to/examples/sample.org"
;;  :title "Project Roadmap"
;;  :children [{:level 1 :title "Planning" :begin 42
;;              :children [{:level 2 :title "Define scope" :todo "TODO"
;;                          :priority "A" :tags ["urgent" "planning"]
;;                          :scheduled "<2026-06-25 Thu>"
;;                          :properties {:EFFORT "2h" :CUSTOM_ID "scope"}
;;                          :begin 87
;;                          :children [...]}
;;                         ...]}
;;             ...]}
```

See the `examples` directory for more. 

## Bundled libraries

Payload format is **EDN**. 

### `pod.babashka.emacs`

| Var         | Args               | Returns                              | Notes |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|-------|
| `eval`      | `[code]`           | the value of the last form, as EDN   | `code` is a string of one or more top-level elisp forms; they are read and evaluated as a `progn`. |
| `eval-file` | `[path]`           | the file's base name (string)        | `load`s an `.el` file into the (warm) Emacs process. Useful for defining helpers you then call via `funcall`. |
| `funcall`   | `[fn & args]`      | the function's return value, as EDN  | Calls the named elisp function `fn` (string or symbol) with `args`. The args are marshalled from EDN to elisp values, so you pass *data*, not string-spliced code — no `(str "(" ... ")")`. Pairs with `eval-file`: load helpers, then call them with real arguments. |
| `version`   | `[]`               | map                                  | `{:emacs-version "31.0.50" :major-version 31 :exec "/path/to/emacs"}`. |

```clojure
(emacs/eval "(mapcar #'1+ '(1 2 3))")   ;=> (2 3 4)
(emacs/version)
;;=> {:emacs-version "31.0.50", :major-version 31, :exec "/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs"}

;; funcall passes data, not code — no string-building:
(emacs/funcall "upcase" "hi")            ;=> "HI"
(emacs/funcall "format" "%s-%d" "x" 7)   ;=> "x-7"
;; load your own elisp, then call it with real arguments:
(emacs/eval-file "my-helpers.el")
(emacs/funcall "my-report" {:env "prod"} [1 2 3])
```

**elisp → EDN value mapping** (via `parseedn`, with a thin wrapper for
predictability):

| elisp                         | EDN       |
|-------------------------------|-----------|
| hash-table                    | map       |
| plist / list                  | list      |
| vector                        | vector    |
| keyword                       | keyword   |
| `t`                           | `true`    |
| `nil`                         | `nil`     |
| non-serializable (buffer, fn) | string repr |

### `pod.babashka.emacs.org`

Each reads or runs an org file through real org-mode in a throwaway buffer.

| Var         | Args              | Returns                                          | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `outline`   | `[path]` / `[path opts]` | `{:file :title :children [node ...]}`     | Nested headline tree. `:title` is the `#+TITLE:` keyword (may be `nil`). |
| `headlines` | `[path]` / `[path opts]` | vector of nodes (flat, document order)    | Same nodes as `outline` but un-nested (no `:children`). |
| `to-edn`    | `[path]` / `[path opts]` | `{:file :title :children [node ...]}`     | Like `outline`, but every node also gets a `:body` (the entry's text, excluding subheadings). |
| `src-blocks`| `[path]` / `[path opts]` | vector of block nodes (document order)    | Lists every src block so a driver can discover and address them. Each node: `:index` (0-based), `:name` (or `nil`), `:lang`, `:begin`, `:header-args` (map, or `nil`), `:body`. |
| `execute`   | `[path]` / `[path opts]` | the block's result, as EDN                | Runs one org-babel src block and returns its value. Pick the block with `opts` (`:name` / `:index` from `src-blocks`); see below. The block's language backend autoloads (`sh`/`bash`/… → `ob-shell`, else `ob-LANG`). `org-confirm-babel-evaluate` is bound to `nil`, so blocks run without prompting. |

`opts` is an EDN map. Recognized keys:

| Opt          | Type   | Used by      | Effect |
|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| `:max-level` | int    | the readers  | Only include headlines at or above this depth (level ≤ N). |
| `:name`      | string | `execute`    | Run the block whose `#+name:` matches. |
| `:index`     | int    | `execute`    | Run the Nth src block (0-based, document order). |

`execute` with no `:name`/`:index` runs the file's sole src block, or errors if
there are several. Out-of-range `:index` and unknown `:name` both error.

```clojure
(org/execute "examples/sample.org" {:index 0})  ;=> "hello"   ; the echo block
(org/execute "tasks.org" {:name "deploy"})       ; run the block named "deploy"
```

```clojure
(org/headlines "examples/sample.org" {:max-level 1})
;;=> [{:level 1 :title "Planning" :begin 42}
;;    {:level 1 :title "Implementation" :begin 388}
;;    {:level 1 :title "Done" :begin 508}]
```

**Node shape.** A headline node is a map. Only `:level`, `:title`, and `:begin`
are always present; the rest appear only when the headline has them:

| Key           | Type             | Always? | Meaning |
|---------------|------------------|---------|---------|
| `:level`      | int              | yes     | Outline depth (1 = top). |
| `:title`      | string           | yes     | Headline text (no TODO/priority/tags). |
| `:begin`      | int              | yes     | Buffer position of the headline. |
| `:todo`       | string           | no      | TODO keyword, e.g. `"TODO"` / `"DONE"`. |
| `:priority`   | string           | no      | Priority cookie, e.g. `"A"`. |
| `:tags`       | vector of string | no      | Headline tags. |
| `:properties` | map              | no      | Drawer properties, keyword-keyed (skips org's built-ins like `CATEGORY`/`PRIORITY`/`TODO`/`TAGS`). |
| `:scheduled`  | string           | no      | `SCHEDULED:` timestamp, raw. |
| `:deadline`   | string           | no      | `DEADLINE:` timestamp, raw. |
| `:children`   | vector of node   | no      | Sub-headlines (omitted on leaves). |
| `:body`       | string           | no      | Entry text. Only from `to-edn`. |

### `pod.babashka.emacs.calc`

Hand arbitrary-precision arithmetic, exact fractions, units, and symbolic
algebra to Emacs' built-in **Calc** and get the formatted result back as a
string.

| Var       | Args           | Returns       | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| `eval`    | `[expr]`       | result string | `expr` is a Calc algebraic expression (e.g. `"2^100"`, `"sqrt(2)"`, `"evalv(pi)"`). Big integers, exact fractions, matrices and symbolic algebra all work. |
| `convert` | `[expr units]` | result string | Re-express `expr` (which carries its own units) in the target `units`. |

Precision is Calc's default; there is no per-call precision knob — Calc caches
precision in process-global state and the Emacs child is long-lived, so a change
would leak into unrelated later calls. Pass an explicit form like `"evalv(pi)"`
for numeric output. A malformed expression throws with Calc's parser message.

```clojure
(calc/eval "2^100")           ;=> "1267650600228229401496703205376"
(calc/eval "sqrt(2)")         ;=> "1.41421356237"
(calc/convert "2 in" "cm")    ;=> "5.08 cm"
(calc/convert "55 mph" "kph") ;=> "88.51392 kph"
```

### `pod.babashka.emacs.project`

Point Emacs' built-in **`project`** library at a path and read the enclosing
project's root and tracked files, using the same VC-aware detection Emacs uses
interactively.

| Var     | Args                     | Returns           | Notes |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `root`  | `[path]`                 | root dir (string) | Absolute path of the project enclosing `path`. Throws if `path` is in no project. |
| `files` | `[path]` / `[path opts]` | vector of paths   | The project's tracked files. With `{:relative true}` the paths are relative to the root; otherwise absolute. |

`path` may be any file or directory inside the project.

```clojure
(project/root ".")                   ;=> "/home/me/src/myproj/"
(project/files "." {:relative true}) ;=> ["README.md" "src/core.clj" ...]
```

### `pod.babashka.emacs.org-roam`

Read an [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/) knowledge graph as data: the nodes
in a roam directory and the backlinks pointing at any one of them. org-roam is
an external package, so the pod installs it on first `require` (via
`use-package` with `:ensure`).

| Var         | Args            | Returns             | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| `nodes`     | `[]` / `[opts]` | vector of node maps | Every node in the roam directory. Each: `:id`, `:title`, `:file`, `:level`, `:tags`. |
| `backlinks` | `[opts]`        | vector of link maps | Backlinks to the node `:id`. Each: `:source-id`, `:source-title`, `:point`. |

`opts` is an EDN map. Recognized keys:

| Opt          | Type   | Used by     | Effect |
|--------------|--------|-------------|--------|
| `:directory` | string | both        | The org-roam directory to read (defaults to the configured `org-roam-directory`). |
| `:id`        | string | `backlinks` | The node whose backlinks to return (required). |

The org-roam SQLite db is synced on each call, so results reflect the
directory's current contents.

```clojure
(org-roam/nodes {:directory "~/roam"})
;;=> [{:id "a1b2…" :title "Zettelkasten" :file "~/roam/zk.org" :level 0 :tags []}
;;    ...]
(org-roam/backlinks {:directory "~/roam" :id "a1b2…"})
;;=> [{:source-id "c3d4…" :source-title "Note-taking" :point 312}]
```

### `pod.babashka.emacs.devops`

Bridge the external [devops](https://github.com/kpassapk/devops.el) package —
which tangles and runs org-babel src blocks against remote TRAMP targets — into
the pod. devops' own commands are interactive and act on the buffer at point;
this namespace drives its noninteractive engine over a file path passed from
babashka. The package is installed on first `require` via `use-package` with
`:vc`.

| Var       | Args     | Returns               | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------|-------|
| `tangle`  | `[opts]` | vector of result maps | Tangle a heading's src blocks to its devops target(s). Each result: `:tag` (the heading's target tag), `:target` (the resolved TRAMP path), `:files` (count of files written). |
| `execute` | `[opts]` | the block's result    | Run one src block against its enclosing heading's target. Pick the block like `org/execute` (`:name` / `:index`). |

`opts` is an EDN map:

| Opt          | Type   | Used by   | Effect |
|--------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| `:file`      | string | both      | Path to the org file (**required**). |
| `:heading`   | string | `tangle`  | Tangle the heading with this exact title. |
| `:custom-id` | string | `tangle`  | Tangle the heading with this `CUSTOM_ID` (stable across title edits). |
| `:all`       | bool   | `tangle`  | Tangle every target-tagged heading in the file instead. |
| `:name`      | string | `execute` | Run the block whose `#+name:` matches. |
| `:index`     | int    | `execute` | Run the Nth src block (0-based, document order). |

`tangle` needs exactly one of `:heading`, `:custom-id`, or `:all`. A heading's
target tag resolves to a `:dir` that devops injects into the block's babel
params, so the block tangles/runs on its target. `org-confirm-babel-evaluate` is
bound to `nil`.

```clojure
(devops/tangle {:file "infra.org" :all true})
;;=> [{:tag "web01" :target "/ssh:web01:/etc/nginx/" :files 2} ...]
(devops/execute {:file "infra.org" :name "deploy"})
```


## Adding libraries

To use built-in emacs package from Clojure, add a file to `resources/`, call `pod-emacs-register` with the functions you want
to expose, and add the deferred named 

For example, let's say we have want to be able to require `pod.babashka.emacs.foo` from Clojure, with elisp functions `foo-func1` 
and Clojure functions `(foo/func1)`. We would add a file like this to `resources/pod-emacs-foo.el`:

```
;;; Code:

(defun pod-emacs-func1 ()
  (foo-func1))
... 
(pod-emacs-register
 "pod.babashka.emacs.foo"
 `(("func1"    . ,#'pod-emacs-func1)))
 
(provide 'pod-emacs-foo)
;;; pod-emacs-foo.el ends here
```

Finally, we would add add the [named feature](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Named-Features.html)  to `pod-emacs--deferred`

```
(defvar pod-emacs--deferred
  ... 
  ("pod.babashka.emacs.foo" . pod-emacs-foo)
... 
```

If the library is not built into emacs, you can pass in a `use-package` form. When the library is required (in Clojure), 
the pod will attempt to install it. For example, here we are installing [devops.el](https://github.com/kpassapk/devops.el):

```
("pod.babashka.emacs.devops" .
     (pod-emacs-devops . (:use-package devops
				       :ensure t
				       :vc (:url "https://github.com/kpassapk/devops.el"))))
```

## Errors

An elisp error becomes a thrown `ex-info` on the babashka side. The Emacs error
message is the `ex-message`; `ex-data` carries the error symbol and the var:

```clojure
(try
  (emacs/eval "(error \"boom\")")
  (catch clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo e
    (ex-message e)  ;=> "boom"
    (ex-data e)))   ;=> {:type "error", :var "pod.babashka.emacs/eval"}
```

## Emacs resolution

When the pod starts, the shim resolves an Emacs binary in this order:

1. **`$POD_BABASHKA_EMACS_BIN`** — explicit override; used as-is.
2. **Cached download** — a portable build previously downloaded by the pod
   (under the cache dir).
3. **System `emacs`** on `PATH` (on macOS it also checks
   `/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs`).

Customize via these environment variables:

| Env var                    | Purpose                                                         |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `POD_BABASHKA_EMACS_BIN`   | Force a specific Emacs executable (skips all other resolution). |
| `POD_BABASHKA_EMACS_CACHE` | Cache directory for downloaded builds and `emacs.log`.          |
| `BABASHKA_PODS_OS_NAME`    | Babashka's os-name override (used to pick the download).        |
| `BABASHKA_PODS_OS_ARCH`    | Babashka's os-arch override (used to pick the download).        |

Unless overriden by `$POD_BABASHKA_EMACS_CACHE`, the pod sets the cache directory to
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pod-babashka-emacs` or `~/.cache/pod-babashka-emacs`.

## Troubleshooting

The Emacs child's stderr (warnings, errors, messages) is logged to `<cache>/emacs.log` (e.g. `~/.cache/pod-babashka-emacs/emacs.log`). 

The pod also prints the resolved emacs path to stderr on startup.

If calls hang, it could be that Emacs that wrote something unexpected to stdout, or a download is in progress. Check `emacs.log`.
